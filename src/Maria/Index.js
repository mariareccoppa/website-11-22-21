          also would love to learn Python and get PCAP certified on my own time!

        <h2> What has coding taught me? (so far) </h2>
        <p>
          Coding has taught me to continue pushing through my problems no matter
          what. There is always a solution for everything!

        <h3> What inspired me to love coding? </h3>
        <p>
          I started using my parents computer when I was only 5 years old! I
          always loved changing the small settings in their computer to see what
          would happen. I was very curious as a child and I would constantly ask
          my dad about the quickly changing technology I saw around me. As I got
          older, I would help my parents with minor computer problems they had,
          and I realized I enjoyed it very much! I also used to hack Nintendo
          consoles with my brother, we both installed{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)#Wii">
            Homebrew
          </a>{" "}
          software onto the Wii we used to use all the time. Wondering how these
          hacks worked and how people were able to write the code for them got
          me even more curious! Ever since then I have always been interested in
          computers and technology.
